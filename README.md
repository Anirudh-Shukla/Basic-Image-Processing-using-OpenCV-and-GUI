Write a program to perform basic image processing functions with openCV and show the result in GUI such as flask, Tkinter, Matlab etc. Basic image processing functions require:

1) Browse to upload an image.

2) Convert the image in RGB, Grayscale, Binary (thresholding) etc by user choice/button.

3) Perform brightness and contrast improvement

4) Perform various image annotation such as to add line, rectangle, circle or text at desired positions.

ABOUT:

Image Processing GUI: The project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter, allowing users to easily interact with various image processing functions and annotations.

OpenCV Image Manipulation: It utilizes the OpenCV library to perform operations such as converting images to different color spaces (RGB, grayscale, binary), adjusting brightness and contrast, and applying annotations like lines, rectangles, circles, and text. 

User Input and Visualization: The GUI allows users to load images, select desired operations through buttons, and provide input coordinates or parameters for annotations. The processed images are displayed in real-time for visual feedback.

Technology Used: Python, OpenCV.
